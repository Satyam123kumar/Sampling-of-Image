# Sampling-of-Image
Using different technique of image processing, to convert a 1080p image into (960×540) i.e., qHD image. And again upsampled this image such, that we lose minimal data
•Used python and OpenCV technique. Libraries like matplotlib and numpy are also used. 
Downsampled the original image by dropping alternate sample. And then upsampled using interpolation technique. 
Applied a Lowpassfilter on original image. And repeated the above process.
Compared and Analyse which technique gives better result by using scikit-imagel ibrary.
